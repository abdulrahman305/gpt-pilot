- **Code Style**: Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Use an auto-formatter like `black` to format your code.
- **Docstrings**: Write clear and concise docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules. Use the Google style for docstrings.
- **Comments**: Write comments to explain the purpose of complex code blocks. Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes. Use the `unittest` framework for writing tests.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature XYZ").
